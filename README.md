# Image_Processing
In deep learning image processing, filters like grayscale, Laplacian, median, low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass are used to enhance or extract features. Grayscale simplifies images, Laplacian detects edges, median removes noise, low-pass smooths, high-pass enhances details, and band-pass filters specific frequency ranges.
